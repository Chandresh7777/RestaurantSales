The **objective** of this project is to explore and analyze the data stored in three tables: "menu," "members," and "sales" using SQLite.
We aim to gain insights into product details, customer information, and purchase patterns.

**Data Description** 
The "menu" table contains information about products, including product_id, product_name, and price.
The "members" table stores data related to customers, including customer_id and join_date.
The "sales" table records customer purchases, including product_id, customer_id, and order_date.

**Data Analysis Steps**

*Data Exploration*

Use SQL queries to retrieve basic information about the tables, such as the number of records and columns, data types, and sample data to get an understanding of the dataset's structure.

*Product Analysis*:

Calculate and summarize product-related metrics such as the number of unique products, average price, and the most expensive/cheapest products.
Identify the most popular products based on the number of purchases.

*Customer Analysis*:

Determine the total number of customers in the dataset.
Analyze customer joining patterns to understand how membership enrollment has evolved over time.
Find the earliest and latest join_date to understand the membership program's duration.

*Purchase Analysis*:

Analyze purchase trends over time to identify any seasonality or trends in customer buying behavior.
Calculate the total revenue generated from sales and identify the highest revenue-generating days or months.

*Membership Impact*:

Investigate the impact of membership on customer purchases by comparing sales made before and after joining.
Calculate average spending per customer before and after membership enrollment.

*Insights and Recommendations*:

Derive insights from the analysis to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the business.
Provide actionable recommendations based on the findings to improve product offerings, marketing strategies, and the membership program.

By performing this data analysis using SQLite, we can gain valuable insights into product popularity, customer behavior, and the impact of the membership program. The analysis will provide data-driven insights and support data-based decision-making to optimize business strategies and enhance overall performance.
